1. **Income Analysis and Predictions** <br/>
   This portfolio is my college assignment. I was assigned to do EDA on the dataset and make predictions from it. The data is taken from the dataset that has been provided in Scele CS UI. This dataset contains data on people with various characteristics. From the characteristics of each person, then their income is annotated whether they are below 50 thousand dollars or above 50 thousand dollars per year. <br/><br/>

2. **House Price Predictions** <br/>
   This is also my college assignment. The main focus on this assignment is data cleansing. But I was also assigned to make predictions on house prices from cleaned data. This dataset is about house prices and this dataset consists of 29451 rows and 12 columns.

2. **Traveloka Chatbot Model** <br/>
   I made this chatbot model in the final project of the Bangkit program. I worked on a Company-Based Capstone Project with Traveloka, called a chatbot application for customer operations handling many complaints and pressing. My team and I also got selected as the Best team for each company's projects at the end of this project.
