1. Portfolio 1: **Income Analysis and Predictions** <br/>
   This portfolio is my college assignment. I was assigned to do EDA on the dataset and make predictions from it. The data is taken from the dataset that has been provided in Scele CS UI. This dataset contains data on people with various characteristics. From the characteristics of each person, then their income is annotated whether they are below 50 thousand dollars or above 50 thousand dollars per year. <br/><br/>
